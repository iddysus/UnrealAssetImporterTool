### 2. **Upload the Script**
It seems like the `unreal_asset_importer_tool.py` script isnâ€™t uploaded yet. To upload the script:
1. Go to your repository.
2. Click on **"Add file"** > **"Upload files"**.
3. Upload the `unreal_asset_importer_tool.py` script file that you downloaded earlier.

### 3. **Check the `.gitignore`**
Make sure that your `.gitignore` is set up correctly to ignore unnecessary files. Since this is a Python project, you should have a `.gitignore` that looks something like this:

```plaintext
# Byte-compiled / optimized / DLL files
__pycache__/
*.py[cod]
*$py.class

# Distribution / packaging
.Python
env/
build/
dist/

# Editor directories and files
.vscode/
.idea/
*.sublime-project
*.sublime-workspace
